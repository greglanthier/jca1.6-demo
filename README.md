# jca1.6-demo [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/greglanthier/jca1.6-demo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/greglanthier/jca1.6-demo) [![Documentation Status](https://readthedocs.org/projects/jca16-demo/badge/)](http://jca16-demo.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html)

A first step towards experimenting with JCA in Liberty Profile using tutorials like
[Introduction to the J2EE Connector Architecture](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/tutorials/j-jca/j-jca.html)
written by Willy Farrell.

To run this build locally you need to set an environment variable called LIBERTY_LICENSE to the value you obtain from [here](http://public.dhe.ibm.com/ibmdl/export/pub/software/websphere/wasdev/downloads/wlp/8.5.5.4/lafiles/runtime/en.html).  This ensures you accept the terms and conditions for the WebSphere Liberty Profile container.

The value for the LIBERTY_LICENSE variable you need is next to the  string **L/N** in the agreement.
